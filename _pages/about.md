I'm an incoming PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Southern California, advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io).
My research interests are natural language processing and representation learning. 

Previously, I received my master's degree with [honors](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/cs_ms_honors/) in the Computer Science Department at University of Southern California in 2021, and my bachelorâ€™s degree with outstanding graduate award from the Computer Science and Technology Department at Renmin University of China in 2019. 

I'm a former intern in the Applied Machine Learning Team at ByteDance, managed by [Youlong Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youlongcheng/).
I also worked closely with [Jiwei Li](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~bdlijiwei/) in his startup.

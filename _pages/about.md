I am an incoming PhD student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io). 
I'm in my gap season, working as a research scientist intern at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html).
My research interest lies in natural language processing. 

Previously, I received my master's degree with honor in Computer Science at USC, where I worked closely with [Pedro Szekely](https://usc-isi-i2.github.io/szekely/) at [USC ISI](https://www.isi.edu/) and [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) at UCLA.
During my master's degree, I interned in the Applied Machine Learning Team at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), led by [Youlong Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youlongcheng/).
Before coming to USC, I spent half a year in [Jiwei Li](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~bdlijiwei/)'s [NLP startup](https://www.shannonai.com/en).
Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honor in Computer Science and Technology at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en), where I worked closely with [Jun Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=su14mcEAAAAJ) and [Zhicheng Dou](http://dou.playbigdata.com/).

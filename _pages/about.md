I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm grateful to be advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io). I am a receipt of the [Amazon ML Fellowship](https://trustedai.usc.edu/20222023-amazon-ml-fellows-1) and the [Annenberg Fellowship](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/fellowships/fellowships-for-phd-students/). Previously, I was a research intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI, Amazon Alexa AI, and Tencent AI Lab (Seattle).

I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My long-term goal is to build **robust, controllable, and accountable large language model**-based systems. My recent work spans across (1) mitigating knowledge conflicts and spurious correlations, (2) guiding text generation using constraints, and (3) enhancing model privacy and security against information leakage and backdoor attacks.

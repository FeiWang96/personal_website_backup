I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm grateful to be advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and to be supported by the [Annenberg Fellowship](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/fellowships/fellowships-for-phd-students/).

Iâ€™m broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My long-term goal is to build **robust, controllable, and accountable large language model**-based systems.

I'm a PhD student in computer science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm grateful to be advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and to be supported by the [Annenberg Fellowship](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/fellowships/fellowships-for-phd-students/).

My research focuses on **robustness in natural language processing**, including
* representation invariance and prediction consistency towards semantic-neutral perturbation,
* unintended bias (e.g. spurious bias, pretraining bias and label bias) detection and mitigation,
* generalization to data with distribution shift.
